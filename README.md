### Demo gameplay
![](/game-test/screen-1.gif)


## Implementation details
Welcome to my Unity game project, a non-commercial endeavor where I've implemented various game mechanics including running, jumping, dashing, enemy AI behavior, character's reaction to falling from a great height, and teleportation at designated points.


## Assets and Resources
Please note, the various resources used in the game such as assets, music, images etc., were not created by me but were downloaded from the internet where they were freely available. I own only the game code and not any of the assets or other similar works that I have used in my game.

## Contact
